# Sorting Algorithms

## Description
This project will strengthen your grasp on Python through practical implementation of sorting algorithms. After acquiring the fundamentals of Python, it's time to apply that knowledge to real-world scenarios. We'll focus on 3 primary sorting algorithms - Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort. We encourage you to add more advanced sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort to your portfolio as a challenge.

Compare the space and time complexity of these sorting algorithms to further grasp the concept of algorithm efficiencies. An optional activity is to implement an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize the performance of your implemented algorithms.
