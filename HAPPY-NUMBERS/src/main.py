def is_happy(n: int) -> bool:
    """
    Checks whether a given number is happy or not.

    A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum
    of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process
    until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops
    endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Those numbers for
    which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

    :param n: The number to check.
    :type n: int
    :returns: True if the number is a happy number, False otherwise
    :rtype: bool

    :Example:

    >>> is_happy(19)
    True

    >>> is_happy(2)
    False
