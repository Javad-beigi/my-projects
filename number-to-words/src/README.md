# Number to Words Converter

The objective of this project is to create a Python function that converts a given integer into its word representation. For example, the number `123` should be converted to the string "one hundred twenty-three". The solution involves breaking down the problem into manageable parts and using a recursive approach to construct the word representation of numbers.

## Problem Breakdown
The conversion of numbers to words is not straightforward due to the irregularities of the English language. The problem can be decomposed into several cases based on the size of the number:

1. **Numbers less than 20**: These are unique words that donâ€™t follow a regular pattern (e.g., "eleven", "seventeen"). We will handle these by direct mapping using a predefined dictionary named `UNDER_20`.

2. **Numbers from 20 to 99**: These are composed of a ten's word and sometimes an additional unit's word (e.g., "twenty-one", "eighty-five"). We will handle these by defining a dictionary named `TENS` for the multiples of ten, and combine them with the necessary unit's word if needed.

3. **Numbers 100 and above**: These require a recursive approach because they are composed of smaller parts that repeat the same pattern (e.g., "two hundred", "one thousand"). We will handle these by defining a dictionary named `ABOVE_100` to map significant number pivots like 100, 1000, and so on to their respective words ("hundred", "thousand", etc.). We then use recursion to break down and convert each part of the number.

## The `num_to_word` Function

The `num_to_word` function is the core of this project. It takes an integer and returns its word representation as a string. The function is implemented as follows:

```python
def num_to_word(num: int) -> str:
    if num < 20:
        # Direct mapping for numbers less than 20
        return UNDER_20[num]
    if num < 100:
        # Concatenation of tens and possibly a unit less than 10
        return TENS[num // 10 - 2] + ("" if num % 10 == 0 else " " + UNDER_20[num % 10])
    # Recursive case for numbers 100 and above
    pivot = max([key for key in ABOVE_100.keys() if key <= num])
    p1 = num_to_word(num // pivot)
    p2 = ABOVE_100[pivot]
    p3 = "" if num % pivot == 0 else " " + num_to_word(num % pivot)
    return p1 + " " + p2 + p3
```

## Detailed Breakdown

1. **Handling Numbers Less Than 20**: 
   - Check if the number is less than 20.
   - Return the corresponding word from the `UNDER_20` dictionary.

2. **Handling Numbers from 20 to 99**:
   - Check if the number is less than 100.
   - Find the word for the tens place from the `TENS` dictionary.
   - Find the word for the units place from the `UNDER_20` dictionary if the remainder is non-zero.
   - Concatenate the tens and unit words appropriately.

3. **Handling Numbers 100 and Above**:
   - Identify the largest pivot value from the `ABOVE_100` dictionary that is less than or equal to the number.
   - Divide the number by this pivot to find the multiplier for the significant number (e.g., "two" in "two hundred").
   - Recursively call `num_to_word` for both the multiplier and the remainder of the division.
   - Concatenate the results to form the full word representation.

This function is designed to handle numbers of any size, as long as they are within the range of standard English number words (up to the largest key in `ABOVE_100`). It uses recursion elegantly to handle the complexity of the English number system in a concise and readable manner.

## Getting Started:

This project includes the following main Python file:

- `main.py`: The main script handles user input and calls the num_to_word function in the same script.

Other required modules and necessary constants are in a separate Python file:

- `constants.py`: This file contains all the constant lists and dictionaries that are necessary for the number-to-word conversion. These constants include UNDER_20, TENS and ABOVE_100.

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
2. Run the `main.py` script using the command `python main.py`.
3. When requested, enter a number to be converted into words.

## Functions and Definitions:

- `num_to_word`: This function accepts an integer and converts it into equivalent English words. It checks the number length and based on the length, the number is converted into words.

- `main`: This function prompts the user to enter an integer number and checks if it's within the specified range (0 to 999999999999). If so, it calls the function num_to_word to convert the input number to words.

- Constants:
  - UNDER_20: This list stores values for numbers under 20.
  - TENS: This list stores values for every tenth number up until 100.
  - ABOVE_100: This dictionary stores values for numbers above 100 and places like 1_000, 1_000_000 and 1_000_000_000.
